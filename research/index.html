<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of physics and computer science, with a particular focus on quantum information, condensed matter physics, and machine learning methods applied to physical systems.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate studies, I completed my final project under the supervision of <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~hilke/" target="_blank">Professor Michael Hilke</a>. I explored quantum computing through the lens of topological protection. Specifically, I studied how topological structures such as the <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.42.1698" target="_blank">Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model</a> can protect qubits from decoherence. I developed a protocol to fine-tune the SSH model such that, even with significant coupling to the environment, the qubit remains robustly protected.</p>

<p>After graduation, I joined the <a href="https://www.lkb.upmc.fr/" target="_blank">Kastler Brossel Laboratory</a> in Paris as a research intern in the <a href="https://www.quentinglorieux.fr/" target="_blank">Quantum Fluid of Light</a> group led by Professor Quentin Glorieux. There, I developed a machine learning tool to better characterize quantum fluids in hot atomic vapors.</p>

<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in the group of Professor Hong Guo at McGill University, known for its leading contributions to computational condensed matter physics. My doctoral work is still in development, and I am exploring problems at the interface of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quantum field theory</li>
  <li>Condensed matter physics</li>
  <li>High-energy physics</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
  <li>Computational physics</li>
</ul>
